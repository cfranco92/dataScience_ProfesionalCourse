## Intro
The world of data science is not something new, since the 60s there were data miners: People dedicated to analyze large amounts of data with statistics. The data miners had a technological limitation because too much data was difficult to process, nowadays thanks to all the improvement in the hardware is that the world of data science has expanded.

The work of a data scientist takes several steps:

Obtaining data.
Enrichment of the data.
Adequacy and interpretation of data.
Application of the model.
Results analysis.
Start of production of the model.

## Introduction to R
R is a programming language to apply statistical techniques to a data set. To install it, we must go to your site at cran.r-project.org and follow the steps of installing our operating system.

Once installed, we will be able to execute R code inside our shell, but to improve our experience when developing we will download RStudio.

To install libraries inside R we only execute the install.packages("spatial) command. Within RStudio we also have a tab that will show us the libraries that we have available and loaded into the project.

When we need to use the package, we could to use library(spatial), for example.
